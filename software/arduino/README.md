# uarm_arduino

Arduino IDE compiles portable which runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS is included here. Just run the installer located in the arduino-1.8.13 folder.

The main code is in firmware.ino.

The libraries are in arduino-1.8.13/portable/sketchbook/libraries/uArmLibrary-3.0.0.

There is old code in arduino-1.8.13/portable/sketchbook/libraries/UArmForArduino.

The rest are research artifacts which will gradually clean themselves up with time.
