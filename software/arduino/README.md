# uarm_arduino

Arduino IDE compiles portable which runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS is included here. Just run the installer located in the arduino-1.8.13 folder.

The main code is in uarm_arduino/arduino-1.8.13/portable/sketchbook/libraries/uArmLibrary-1.7.2.

Another version of the code is in uarm_arduino/arduino-1.8.13/portable/sketchbook/libraries/uArmLibrary-2.2.1.

There is old code in uarm_arduino/arduino-1.8.13/portable/sketchbook/libraries/UArmForArduino.

The rest are research artifacts which will gradually clean themselves up with time.
