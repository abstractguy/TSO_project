class Robot:
    """
    'Robot' Class is intended to be a thread-safe wrapper for whatever communication protocol your robot arm uses,
    as long as it has 4 servos and the communication protocol returns the same format that this class expects.

    The connection is threaded, so that you can connect to your robot via serial while doing other things.
    This comes in handy when using the GUI, so connecting to your robot doesn't lock things up.

    Furthermore, by being thread-safe there will never be issues of communicating with the robot via two different
    threads.

    The biggest advantage of this class is that it avoids communication with the robot at all costs. What this means
    is that it caches all information and commands sent to robot, and will NOT send two commands that are the same.
    So if you tell it to go to X0Y0Z0 (for example) then tell it to go to X0Y0Z0 again, it will not send the second
    command, unless something has occured that would prompt that (like servo detach/attach).

    Furthermore this class will allow you to cut off communication with the robot with the "setExiting" command.
    This allows the user to exit a thread very quickly by no longer allowing the robot to send commands or wait,
    thus speeding up the process of leaving a thread.
