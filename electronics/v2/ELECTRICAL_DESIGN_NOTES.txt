- 3.3V zener for ADC inputs (or 2 diodes per I/O, don't forget capacitor)
- Check voltages everywhere (header connector pins are wrong)
- Plug (choose) ESP-WROOM32 PWM/ADC I/O pins (3.3V <-> 5V transistors, check rise/fall times)
- Check regulator output current (ensure there is enough and if not, reuse older schematics)
- Do this quick!!
