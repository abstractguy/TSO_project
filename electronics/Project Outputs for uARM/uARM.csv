"MCP16311T-E/MS","The MCP16311/2 is a compact, high-efficiency, fixed frequency, synchronous step-down DC-DC converter in an 8-pin MSOP, or 2 x 3 TDFN package that operates from input voltage sources up to 30V. Integrated features include a high-side and a low-side switch, fixed frequency peak current mode control, internal compensation, peak current limit and overtemperature protection. The MCP16311/2 provides all the active functions for local DC-DC conversion, with fast transient response and accurate regulation.","U4","SOP65P490X110-8N","MCP16311T-E/MS","1"
